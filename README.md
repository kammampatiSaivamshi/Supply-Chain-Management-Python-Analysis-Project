# Supply-Chain-Management-Project-Analysis
## AGENDA : 
We have to create a comprehensive Supply Chain Management  (SCM) Dashboard using Powerbi. This dashboard will help monitor and optimize various aspects of the supply chain, including inventory levels, order fulfillment, supplier  performance, transportation efficiency, and overall supply chain costs

## About the Dataset:
- Supply chain analytics is a valuable part of data-driven decision-making in various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and logistics.
- It is the process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting data related to the movement of products and services from suppliers to customers.

SUPPLY CHAIN ORDER FULFILLMENT EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

# Project Objective
This project analyzes and visualizes supply chain order fulfillment performance using Python and Power BI. The goal is to identify bottlenecks, evaluate KPIs, and improve operational efficiency.

# Project Files
- SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT.ipynb: Python notebook for data cleaning, transformation, and EDA.
- SUPPLY CHAIN DASHBOARD.pbix: Power BI file for interactive visualization and insights.

# Tools & Technologies Used
- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
- Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation
- Jupyter Notebook: Data preprocessing and EDA

# Key Analysis Steps

In Python (.ipynb):
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Summary Statistics
- Lead Time and Order Fulfillment Analysis
- Shipment Delay Detection
- Supplier and Product-Level Performance

In Power BI (.pbix):
- Order Fulfillment Dashboard
- KPIs: Lead Time, On-Time Delivery Rate, Delays, Stockouts
- Supplier Performance Overview
- Region-Wise & Product Category-Wise Insights

Dashboard Highlights
- Order Status Overview
- Lead Time Distribution
- On-Time vs Delayed Deliveries
- Supplier Reliability & Fill Rates
- Region-Wise Order Trends

# How to Use
1. Python Analysis:
   Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook "SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT.ipynb"

2. Power BI Dashboard:
   Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop:
   SUPPLY CHAIN DASHBOARD.pbix

# Potential Improvements
- Integrate real-time order data with APIs.
- Build a predictive model for order delay prediction.
- Automate alerts for high-risk supplier performance.
